# SQL Code Challenge

## Introduction

This repository is intended to be my SQL Code Challenge for the Data Analyst position. The questions are taken from the [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com) website. The questions are divided into 3 levels: **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**.

Each directory in this repository represents the level of the questions. The questions are stored in the `README.md` file in each directory. The answers are stored in the `answers.sql` file in each directory
